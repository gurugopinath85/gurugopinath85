# Hi there, I'm Guru 👋

I'm a **sophomore at the University of California, Riverside**, passionate about building innovative software solutions and constantly learning new technologies. Currently, I have a solid understanding of **C++, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS**, and I'm diving deeper into **React.js** and **Node.js** to expand my ability to create applications that enhance user experiences. I also have a growing interest in AI-based learning, and I’m always discovering new concepts in the field.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Use:
- **Programming Languages**: C++, Java, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Expanding my language proficiency to broaden my versatility
- Diving into AI-based education
- Improving my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms
- Other Programming Languages and Libraries

## 😄 Fun facts about me:
- **Avid soccer player**: You can catch me on the field whenever I'm not coding!
- **Heartfulness practitioner**: I practice mindfulness and meditation to stay grounded and focused.
- **Always down to try something new**: Whether it's coding, sports, or life experiences, I'm always up for an adventure.

## 💬 I'm looking for:
- **Advice**: As much of what I've learned so far is self-taught, I’m eager for any feedback to stay ahead of the curve while continuing my education.
